# TMBot (DEPRECATED)
**The components in the TMBot repository (Python package, OpenPlanet plugin, documentation) were created as an independent and self-directed passion project, and are not actively maintained.**

**TMBot** is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) package for Nadeo's [Trackmania 2020](https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/trackmania/trackmania).
It is built off [Stable Baselines 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3) and aims to provide a painless interface for testing and developing
new RL methods in customizable 3D environments. 

**TMBot** uses its supplementary plugin, **TMData**, to communicate with the Trackmania process using the [OpenPlanet](https://openplanet.dev) API.
The documentation for **TMData** is included here as well.
